# Turn-Based Arena Fighter (C++)

A simple console-based turn-based combat game written in C++. The player battles an AI opponent by choosing actions like "Attack" or "Defend" during each turn. This project focuses on fundamental C++ programming concepts such as classes, functions, control flow, and basic game logic.

## ðŸ§  Features

- Turn-based combat between player and AI
- Simple text-based UI via the console
- Basic enemy AI logic
- Player victory/defeat conditions
- Written entirely in C++ (no external libraries)

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- C++
- Standard Library (STL)
- Console I/O

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Goals

- Practice with object-oriented programming in C++
- Implementing simple game logic
- Understanding control flow and functions

## ðŸ“¦ How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
https://github.com/mialskywalker/FightingConsoleGame.git

2. Compile the code:
g++ Game.cpp -o arena-fighter

3. Run the game:
